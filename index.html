        <h3>Mel Bochner</h3>
        <p>
          I would like to note Mel Bochners passing on February 12, 2025. He was
          a valued colleague, a brilliant interlocutor, never brought less than
          his A game to studio visits and reviews, he had a voice that brought
          insight to the conversation, and had an outstanding sense of humor. I
          was fortunate to be his colleague. Students felt fortunate for the
          exchange they shared. He never varnished his truth. May he rest in
          peace.
